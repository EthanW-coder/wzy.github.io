My current research interests are object detection, instance segmentation, and image restoration.

I am currently a postgraduate in Computer Science at [ZJNU](https://www.zjnu.edu.cn/main.htm).


# NEWS
## Paper is on the way
Our paper ["Rethinking Cross-Modality Fusion Mamba from a Frequency Domain Perspective"]() is on the way (under review).

Our paper ["Mamba YOLO: A Simple Baseline for Object Detection with State Space Model"]() is accepted by AAAI2025.

Our paper ["RestorMamba: An Enhanced Synergistic State Space Model for Image Restoration"]() is accepted by ICASSP2025.

Our paper ["MambaInst: Lightweight State Space Model for Real-Time Instance Segmentation"]() is accepted by ICASSP2025.
